this repo contains all the code for a project I conducued in the summer of 2020 at the TREES Research Program at the University of Pennslyvania. 

Right now the repo contains the analysis script I wrote to create the data visualizations I made in my project. It had the dataset post data manipulation and data wrangling script. I am still looking through my old computer hard drive for the files the data wrangling script calls.
